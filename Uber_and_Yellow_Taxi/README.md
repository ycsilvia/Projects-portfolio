# Projects: Uber and Yellow Taxi Trip Data Analysis and Visualization -- Understanding Hired Rides in NYC

Using hired-ride trip data from Uber and NYC Yellow cab from January 2009 through June 2015, and joining with local historical weather data, you will be providing a single Jupyter notebook and SQL queries to answer particular questions by downloading and cleaning data, storing the data in a SQLite database, and providing visualizations.

## Datasets

* Uber rides: a sample of Uber rides from 01-2009 through 06-2015
* Historical weather data: 7 csv files named "xxxx_weather.csv"
* Yellow Taxi trip data: https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
